# Joining Data in SQL

In this course, I learned all about the power of joining tables while exploring interesting features of countries and their cities throughout the world. I mastered inner and outer joins, as well as self joins, semi joins, anti joins and cross joinsâ€”fundamental tools in any PostgreSQL wizard's toolbox. I will never fear set theory again after learning all about unions, intersections, and except clauses through easy-to-understand diagrams and examples. Lastly, I got introduced to the challenging topic of subqueries.
